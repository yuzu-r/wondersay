What is Wonder?
<p>Wonder is a book by RJ Palacio which centers around a fifth grader named August (Auggie) attending school for the first time. Auggie's English teacher, Mr. Browne, presents precepts to his class as a springboard for discussion. Mr. Browne also encourages his students to come up with their own words to live by. On this website, student precepts are displayed with quotes around the author's name.

There are also three short stories and a spinoff book in the same "universe". All are highly recommended!
